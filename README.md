Hi everyone, I am Pablo! 

:man: I am 24 years old and I am from Spain. I am currently living in Amsterdam (Netherlands) where I work as a Bioinformatician for a genomics company.

:books: I studied a BSc in Biotechnology because of my interest in molecular biology and biomedicine. 
I complemented this formation studying a MSc in Computational Biology because I believe that the potential of applying data analysis tools and artificial intelligence approaches to these areas is huge.

:office: I have been involved in different types of projects: studying Alzheimer's disease from a wet lab perspective, research about the application of artificial intelligence to drug discovery from a computational perspective, and currently I work doing genomics data analysis. 

:computer: I have some experience working with bash, R and Python and I am currently focused on learning HTML, SQL and PHP. 

:e-mail: You can reach me sending me an email to: gomezsacristanpablo@gmail.com
